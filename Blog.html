    <li>Splitting.</li>
    <li>Grinding and processing.</li>

      There are multiple waste management strategies and methods available.
      These strategies can be combined or rearranged to form a waste
      management system that fits an organization.</p>
    <p>
      Modern waste management strategies are geared towards sustainability
      Other alternatives for waste management is to reduce, reuse and recycle
      waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also known as physical reprocessing, recycling is ideal for the disposal of
      inorganic waste such as plastic, glass, and metals.
      Though organic waste such as paper and food can also be recycled,
      composting would be a better waste disposal method as it converts organic
      waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer.

    <p>When we dump the waste into the bin it automatically
separates the waste using sensors through detecting the waste
material and under goes the process through different layer ,
and at last we get pure water and pulp from wet waste ,whereas
the dry waste will be crumbled ,and if any excess water it is
 collected at bottom level of it .
</p>
<p>Where as the medi waste is directly collected and sent through
a different chamber to the bottom of the bin Once the waste is
filled its give a indication to empty the bin below And this way
the whole recycling process take place at our home
